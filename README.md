## From Social Engineering Target to SOC Defense

My entry into security wasn't formal. It was being a kid who got targeted by "free robux" and game currency scams. Getting hit by those early social engineering traps didn't just frustrate me: it made me want to understand the mechanics behind the exploit. I turned that curiosity into a career. Now, I use those childhood lessons to stay one step ahead of the same tactics, moving from the one being tricked to the one building the defenses.

## Why I Prioritize Data Integrity

I don't just "do IT." I build systems that are meant to last and stay secure. I view every past system failure or personal mistake as a blueprint for better hardening. My philosophy is simple: security should be the foundation, not a patch you apply at the end. Whether I am configuring a server or monitoring logs, I operate with a "Deny by Default" mindset to ensure that data integrity is never compromised.



## SOC Analyst Skillset

### Detection & Analysis
* **Network Traffic Analysis:** Catching weird behavior and unauthorized lateral movement with Wireshark.
* **SIEM & Log Management:** Using Splunk to aggregate and correlate logs to find the "needle in the haystack."
* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Finding system weaknesses and prioritizing what needs fixing first.

### Incident Response & Operations
* **Forensic Triage:** Running fast assessments on Windows systems to find IoCs before they spread.
* **Case Management:** Keeping incidents organized from start to finish so the response is repeatable.
* **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Hardening directory services and GPOs to keep the environment locked down.

### Security Automation & Engineering
* **Workflow Automation:** Creating playbooks with Shuffle SOAR to handle the boring, repetitive stuff.
* **Infrastructure Hardening:** Setting up secure Linux environments and managing server deployments with security as the priority.
* **Scripting for Defense:** Writing scripts to automate threat mitigation and pull the data I need.

## Staying Up to Date

I monitor these resources daily to track emerging CVEs, CVSS scores, and specific OS vulnerabilities:

### General & Reputation
* **[NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/):** Main repository for standardized vulnerability data.
* **[CISA KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog):** Tracking vulnerabilities used in the wild right now.
* **[VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com):** Go-to for quick IP, URL, and file reputation checks.

### Windows & Linux Specifics
* **[MSRC](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/):** The source for Windows security updates and advisories.
* **[Linux Kernel Security](https://docs.kernel.org/process/security-bugs.html):** Tracking core Linux vulnerabilities.
* **[Debian Security](https://www.debian.org/security/):** High-level tracking for stable Linux patches.

## Featured Technical Projects
* **[Profile Rundown & Methodology](https://github.com/nicholasC03/nicholasC03-Profile-Rundown):** A comprehensive breakdown of my current technical focus and security environment.
* **DNS Anomaly & Remediation Lab:** Investigating shady DNS behavior and setting up DNS-over-TLS (DoT).
* **Windows Triage & IR Project:** Simulating a compromise to isolate artifacts and document the response process.
* **Asset Inventory API (In-Progress):** A Java tool I'm building to map out an attack surface and track assets.

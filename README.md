## From Social Engineering Target to SOC Defense

My entry into security wasn't formal. It was being a kid who got targeted by "free robux" and game currency scams. Getting hit by those early social engineering traps didn't just frustrate me: it made me want to understand the mechanics behind the exploit. I turned that curiosity into a career. Now, I use those childhood lessons to stay one step ahead of the same tactics, moving from the one being tricked to the one building the defenses.

## Why I Prioritize Data Integrity

I care for peoples' well-being and I want to help educate those in keeping their digital identity and PII safe! I build systems that are meant to last and stay secure. My philosophy is simple: security should be the foundation, not a patch you apply at the end. Whether I am configuring a server or monitoring logs, I operate with a "Deny by Default" mindset to ensure that data integrity is never compromised.
